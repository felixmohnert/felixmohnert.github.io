I'm not sure if this is a developer's idiosyncrasy, but since I am such a thing, I started increasingly questioning things in every days live. It's about simplifying, enhance sense, questioning processes and being more aware of what happens around you.

## Simplify

Why has my working environment to be such a pain in the ass?

It hasn’t! In developer communities everyone has quite strong opinions but the predominant percentage is able to discuss businesslike. Businesslike? Thats what business people pretend they are. Imagination and reality are far from being identical in business departments. In my earlier days I studied business and worked in marketing. That’s why I have a opinion on that.

The second point: In developer teams there is no such a things as 9 to 5, endless meetings and being on-site always. The more you learn the more freedom you get.
