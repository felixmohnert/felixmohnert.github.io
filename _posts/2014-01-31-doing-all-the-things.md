I'm not sure if this is a developer's idiosyncrasy, but since I am such a [**thing**](/hi), I started increasingly questioning things in every days live. It's about simplifying work, enhance meaning, questioning processes and being more aware of what happens around you.

## Simplify

Why has my working environment to be such a pain in the ass?

It hasn’t! In developer communities everyone has quite strong opinions but the predominant percentage is able to discuss businesslike.

The second point: In developer teams there are no such things as 9 to 5, endless meetings and being always  on-site. The more you learn the more freedom you get.

## Enhance

Since I develop, I started reading more books, both on- and off-topic. On-Topic because what I do suddenly has a real meaning. I create things people actually use. I create workflows before they even exist and sometimes have absolutely no idea how to find out whats best. To get better and don’t get lost you have to improve constantly.

The off-topic book [**Eating Animals**](https://readmill.com/books/sample-of-eating-animals) changed how I think about food production. It enhanced my amount of knowledge on that topic dramatically. After all it’s just the most rationally thing to reduce meat and diary consumption. Why didn’t tell me anyone before?

## Improve

There is a lot to improve. My english for example (quite obvious). My new years resolutions this year include a improved time management, improved focus on important things, improved coding skills to just count a few. Sounds quite ambitious, he?

But you know what? I'll improve all the mentioned things just by being a coder. How great.

## Blog

Thats by far the hardest new years resolution. It’s time consuming, thought enhancing and not trivial for someone who never thought of it as a reasonable idea. Anyway, here it is.
