I am not sure if this is an idiosyncrasy of developers, but since I've been
starting to earn my living as such a [**thing**](/hi), I have increasingly
started to question things in every day live, like the environment that you work
in, and the time that you have - or at least should have - to care about other
things than work. And I have started to change habits - last but not least by
writing this blog.

## Like what you do!

First off, I really enjoy my job a lot!
Developers are pragmatic when it comes to their working environment. Common
business habits don't count in tech. It starts with your college degree: In my
case, nobody ever asked for it because it doesn't count as much as in other
fields. What counts is how you are, what you are able to do and most important:
What you are willing to learn.

Working hours and physical attendance in your office also work a little
differently in tech. They are both not as important since you are basically able
to work from anywhere anytime.

If you are lucky, you get deployment rights right from the beginning, sit next
to the CTO and do the same things as he does. Hierarchy is not the same as for
example in a classic sales army, where everyone, except for the boss, has to be
compliant. And if you're not satisified with your job you can quit ... and
probably find a new job within a relatively short amount of time.

## Improve

What I do for a living suddenly has a real meaning. I create things people
actually use. I create workflows before they even exist and quite often have to
put a lot of brain power into something before I find a solution. To get better
at this and not get lost you have to improve constantly.

2014 will be a year of improving. Mostly programming skills. But also other
things as my own confidence as a programmer, fluency in human languages or my
sports skills. If the job is fulfilling you start paying more attention to other
things as well. For example food:

The book
[**Eating Animals**](https://readmill.com/books/sample-of-eating-animals)
changed how I think about food production and consumption. It improved my
knowledge on that topic dramatically. After all it’s just the most rational
thing to do to reduce the consumption of meat and dairy products.


## Blogging (WTF)

That's by far the hardest new years resolution I had for 2014. It’s time
consuming, thought enhancing and not trivial for someone who never thought of it
as a reasonable idea. Anyway, here. is. my. blog.
