sure if this is a developer's idiosyncrasy, but since I am such a [**thing**](/hi), I started increasingly questioning things in every days live. It's about simplifying work, enhance meaning, questioning processes and being more aware of what happens around you.

## Simplify

Why has the working environment to be such a pain in the ass?

It doesn't! Developers are down-to-earth when it comes to their working environment. Common business habits don't count in tech. It starts with your college degree, nobody ever asked for it because it doesn't count. What counts is how you are, what you are, what you are able to do and most important: What you are willing to learn.

Working hours and presence time are the next exceptional things in tech. They are both not important since you are able to work anywhere anytime. Most likely your boss won't be able to understand what you do, that's another reason why office presence isn't demanded.

If you are lucky, you get deployment rights right from the beginning, sit next to the CTO and do the same things as he does. Hierarchy is not the same as for example in a classic sales army, where everyone, except for the boss, has to be sheepish. All in all, you mostly like your work, your colleagues and often even your boss. If not: You are in a quite good position and could quit the shit.

## Enhance

Since I develop, I started reading increasingly more books, both, programmers books and off-topic books. On-Topic because what I do, suddenly has a real meaning. I create things people actually use. I create workflows before they even exist and sometimes have to put a lot of brain work in something, to find out what's best. To get better and don’t get lost you have to improve constantly.

2014 Will be a year of enhancing. Mostly programming knowledge. But other things as confidence in programming, fluency in human languages or athleticism. Since the job is fulfilling other parts in life get more attention as well. For example food:

The off-topic book [**Eating Animals**](https://readmill.com/books/sample-of-eating-animals) changed how I think about food production. It enhanced my amount of knowledge on that topic dramatically. After all it’s just the most rationally thing to reduce meat and dairy product consumption. Why didn’t tell me anyone?


## Blogging (WTF)

That's by far the hardest new years resolution I had for 2014. It’s time consuming, thought enhancing and not trivial for someone who never thought of it as a reasonable idea. Anyway, here. is. my. blog.
