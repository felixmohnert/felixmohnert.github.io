After I had finished my degree in Business Administration at Freie Universit√§t Berlin I decided to say goodbye to any habits and started with Ruby. This was 2012 and since then, I changed perspective on many things.

At some point I started visiting the Ruby User Group Berlin ([**RUG::B**](http://berlin.onruby.de)), traveled to Israel for [**Rails Israel**](http://railsisrael2013.events.co.il/tracks) and will visit [**wroc_love.rb**](http://wrocloverb.com) soon. In addition I began to realize: This is massive. It's not just Ruby on Rails, there is so much more.

That reslults in my hardest challange: Learn all the things without having a profound dev backround.

## Things I learn(ed)

* Ruby 1.9 / 2.0
* Rails 3.2 / 4.0
* HTML / eRuby / Haml
* CSS/ Compass /Sass
* Bootstrap 2 / 3
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku / cloudControl
* Git / Github
* Javascript / / Coffeescript / jQuery
* Sinatra
