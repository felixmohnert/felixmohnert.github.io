After I finished my degree in Business Administration at Freie Universit√§t Berlin I decided to say goodbye to my old habits and started to learn programming. This was in 2012, and since then, I changed perspective on many things.

My hardest challenge so far is: Learning all the things without having a profound dev backround.

## Things I learn(ed)

* Ruby 1.9 / 2.0
* Rails 3.2 / 4.0
* HTML / eRuby / Haml
* CSS/ Compass /Sass
* Bootstrap 2 / 3
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku / cloudControl
* Git / Github
* Javascript / / Coffeescript / jQuery
* Sinatra
* Teaching Ruby on Rails to Beginners
* Blogging

I'm currently working for DaWanda, a European marketplace for unique goods. You can read about our dev challenges in our Blog that I set up: [Code o'Clock](http://www.codeoclock.com).
